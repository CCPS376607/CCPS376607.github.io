          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>In my personal life I am working towards having a successful career so I can support my future family and buy my dream house.I am working towards this goal by trying hard in school to set myself up for a career that can support me and my future family. I am working towards being in the National Guard because it will pay for my college tuition and I enjoy helping others. The experiences that led me here were that a spokes woman from national guard showed up at the school and came to talk about National Guard and it intrigued me. I am working towards these goals by being in JROTC. I am also working towards being a dermatologist because I am interested in skincare.  I am certified in CPR training which can help me in the future since I'm hoping to have a career in the medical field. I also got a school award in middle school for journalism. Short-term goals I want to accomplish are getting my driver's license. Another short term goal I want to accomplish is improving my rank from corporal to sergeant in JROTC. The values I consider most necessary for my success are confidence, kindness, and being down to earth. I want to be know as an honest and brave person.</p>
